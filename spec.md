# DPG-RPS Specification

## ***Components***

1. Launcher 

    ***Description***
    * This app is meant to facilitate initiating the game experience.
    * Because DPG-RPS comes as a bundle, the Launcher will serve as the single interface for both Client and Server.

    ***Utilizes***
    * server.authenticate()
    * server.register_new_user()
    * server.request_connection()
    * server.request_available_players()
    * server.request_connection_with_player()

    ***API Functions***
    * none

    ***Internal Functions***
    * // TODO

1. Client

    ***Description***
    * While the Server is naturally the brain, and the Launcher is the GUI, what space does that leave for the Client?
    * The Client does not have a very glamorous job. In essence, it serves as the translator and messenger for instructions from the Brain to the Body. 
    * The Client is GUI-agnostic. The objective is to expose an API that could be consumed by ANY framework, and to separate two major concerns: 
        * Coordinating the flow of the game
        * Providing an interface for the game

    ***Utilizes***
    * server.submit_move(Move)

    ***API Functions***
    * // TODO

    ***Internal Functions***
    * listen_for_command(Server)
    * command_interpreter(Command)
    * consume_game_state()


1. Server

    ***Description***
    * Okay, big brain time. 
    * Regardless of where the ball was hit from, this is where the game is "played".
    * What I mean is that it's the Server's job to guarantee that the game state is consistent across Clients. 
    * Your move will be submitted to the Server, and the Server will tell you what happened. 
    * The Server will never ask the Client to make an assumption about game state, or ask it to infer a result, or to perform a calculation.


    ***Utilizes***
    * none

    ***API Functions***
    * register_new_user()
    * authenticate()
    * request_connection()
    * request_available_players()
    * request_connection_with_player()

    ***Internal Functions***
    * // TODO

    ***Attributes***
    * lobby: List(User)
    * active_game_sessions: List(Game)
    * active_connections: List(Connection)
